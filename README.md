It is a APi based program to track the price of an amazon product.
It periodically checks price of the product. If the product comes within the budget input by the user it sends an email to notify the user with the amazon product's link.
The file contain both python(.py) and .exe file which can be excessed by clicking on main.exe.
It struggled with the different ids for different products, so I have to consider three different ids which I was able to identify. If the program is not able to retrive price of a specific product than try another product.
Some time windows security flags it as a virus, so if the program do not run try disabling windows security.
I got to learn these libraries from the Youtube channal Dev Ed : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q
I also get the idea to implement sending email through him.
